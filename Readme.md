Pong-OS
======

PongOs is a toy project which was inspired from MikeOS. PongOS grew out of my fascination of making a standalone application (the Pong Game) which would not need the support of any operating system.

How To
------

To emulate PongOS without risking a pendrive, you need to install **qemu**. To emulate PongOS using qemu, run the following "sudo make emulate"
